# Front-End Nanodegree Arcade Game

This arcade game was built utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This game is a simple application that resembles the classic Frogger game we all played as a child.

## How To Play The Game
For a live demo of this game you can click [here.](http://www.designsbyregina.com/projects/arcadegame/index.html)

To play this game, you have to get the player at the bottom of the screen up to the water at the top. The enemies (bugs) are going across the screen at varying speeds. If your player collides with one of the enemies, then the player will be sent back to the starting position. You can use the up, right, down and left arrows to move your player around on the screen. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
